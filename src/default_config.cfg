## DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE THIS FILE! If you need to make changes, then copy this file, save it as "config.cfg" in the 
## plugin root directory, and edit that file instead!

# This is the configuration file for the Rockstar plugin. It contains settings which advanced users may change to alter
# how the plugin functions. An explanation describing what each setting does is provided beneath each setting.

user_presence_mode=1
# Default Value: 1
# Allowed Values:
#   - 0 (Disable User Presence)
#   - 1 (Display Last Played Game)
#   - 2 (Display Grand Theft Auto Online Character Stats)
#   - 3 (Display Red Dead Online Character Stats)
# Since the online status of a Social Club user is found via an endpoint with its own API, bearer token, and more, it is
# not feasible to get the presence of a user's friends. (For those wondering, the endpoint is
# https://prod.ros.rockstargames.com/scui/v2/api/friend/getfriends.)
# Due to this limitation, a more creative approach has been taken as a compromise for importing friend presence status.
# The allowed values along with their respective meanings are displayed above.

launch_game_from_shell=False
# Default Value: False
# Allowed Values:
#   - True
#   - False
# For a very small minority of users, the plugin might crash for unknown reasons when launching a game,
# unless the request is sent directly through the shell. (See https://github.com/tylerbrawl/Galaxy-Plugin-Rockstar/issues/43
# for more information.) If you are experiencing inexplicable crashes when attempting to launch a game, then enabling
# this setting might fix it.
# Do not enable this setting if the plugin is not crashing when launching a game with the setting set to false.

log_sensitive_data=False
# Default Value: False
# Allowed Values:
#   - True
#   - False
# If set to true, this setting will add extra information to the log file generated by the Rockstar plugin. This
# information is highly sensitive in nature, and may compromise the security of your Rockstar account. As such, it is
# best left to false, unless you are debugging the plugin.

debug_always_refresh=False
# Default Value: False
# Allowed Values:
#   - True
#   - False
# If set to true, the plugin will always attempt to refresh the user's credentials upon launching Galaxy 2.0. This is
# useful for debugging credential refreshing, but serves no purpose for the average user.
