# Rockstar Games Integration for GOG Galaxy 2.0

This plugin adds unofficial integration with the Rockstar Games Social Club and the Rockstar Games Launcher for GOG Galaxy 2.0.

## Installation:
Extract the plugin.zip directory from [the releases section of this repository][rel] and place the entire Rockstar folder within the plugins directory. If the plugin was installed correctly, then your directory tree will look like this:

```sh
C:\Users\[Your-Username]\AppData\Local\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed\Rockstar
```

In the above directory listing, [Your-Username] is the name of your current user profile. If you are unsure of your computer user name, this directory is the same as the one above:

```sh
%LOCALAPPDATA%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed\Rockstar
```

#### NOTE: The Rockstar Games Launcher is currently only available on Windows. There is no plugin for the Mac version of GOG Galaxy 2.0.
