# Rockstar Games Integration for GOG Galaxy 2.0

This plugin adds unofficial integration with the Rockstar Games Social Club and the Rockstar Games Launcher for GOG Galaxy 2.0.

## Installation:
Extract the plugin.zip directory from [the releases section of this repository][rel] and place the entire Rockstar folder within the plugins directory. If the plugin was installed correctly, then your directory tree will look like this:

```sh
C:\Users\[Your-Username]\AppData\Local\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed\Rockstar
```

In the above directory listing, [Your-Username] is the name of your current user profile. If you are unsure of your computer user name, this directory is the same as the one above:

```sh
%LOCALAPPDATA%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed\Rockstar
```

#### NOTE: The Rockstar Games Launcher is currently only available on Windows. There is no plugin for the Mac version of GOG Galaxy 2.0.

## Additional Notes:
  - Currently, GOG Galaxy 2.0 does not have the Rockstar platform supported. As such, the integration will show up as Riot until the Rockstar Games Launcher is given its own platform.
  - There is currently no support for achievements nor game time, although the former may be implemented later. However, friend recommendations are supported (although I cannot test them).
  - This plugin reads the log file generated by the Rockstar Games Launcher to find the collection of owned games. If GOG Galaxy 2.0 displays an incorrect library, then make sure to log in to the actual Rockstar Games Launcher at least once. A future solution using Rockstar's database may be possible, but it would be unlikely.
  - Please report any bugs that you find at [the issues section of this repository][issues], especially those regarding installation and uninstallation. Most of the install location registry keys were guesses.
